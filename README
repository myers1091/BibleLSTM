This is a LSTM RNN to read in a book of the bible and use it to 
generate new text.

The first iteration uses character prediction and the second is an attempt at 
word by word prediction

splitter.py  divides the bible into cleaned up books 

lstmRNN.py is the character by character version

lstmRNN_imporved.py is c-b-c but with a more complex network

lstmRNN_wordlevel.py is the word version of the improved model

gen_text.py takes the best weights and uses it to predict new text

currently, The word version needs to have spaces handled better
Additionally, try to train grammer before doing bible training
